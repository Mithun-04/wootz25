Each team member receives a different set of questions—one listing material properties and the other listing applications. Initially, they must eliminate the two least likely options on their paper within 10 minutes. Then, they exchange papers, and the second member selects the correct answer from the remaining choices. Accuracy and speed determine the winners, but communication is strictly prohibited during the round."
