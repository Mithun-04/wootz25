          "name": "Material Match",
          "description": "In this round, teams of two work collaboratively to match material properties with their correct applications. Each team member receives a different set of questions—one listing material properties and the other listing applications. Initially, they must eliminate the two least likely options on their paper within 10 minutes. Then, they exchange papers, and the second member selects the correct answer from the remaining choices. Accuracy and speed determine the winners, but communication is strictly prohibited during the round."

          "name": "Pictionary",
          "description": "This round introduces a creative element where one team member draws clues representing a metallurgical term while the other tries to guess it. However, direct depictions of the term, letters, numbers, or symbols are not allowed. The goal is to interpret the clues correctly within two minutes per term. The team with the most correct guesses wins."

          "description": "Participants step into the shoes of forensic metallurgists, solving real-life material failure case studies. Given clues, they must identify the issue, the material involved, and the root cause of failure using logical reasoning and metallurgical expertise. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the analysis and the strength of their argument."

A correct answer within 10 seconds doubles their points, while a wrong answer results in losing the same amount. If the first team fails, the question is passed to the next team for a standard point value. The team with the highest score at the end wins, testing both knowledge and strategic risk-taking."

Points are awarded based on accuracy and the quality of justification. This round enhances critical thinking by encouraging participants to distinguish between facts and misconceptions, promoting scientific awareness and curiosity."

          "description": "This hands-on round introduces participants to casting by having them create molds using plaster of Paris. They mix and pour the material over a model object, wait for it to set, then carefully remove the model to reveal a detailed mold. Once hardened, the mold can be refined and used for further casting applications. This round provides a practical learning experience in material processing and mold-making techniques."
